```

The scripts in `src/pk_helpers` provide platform-specific utilities used by
the notebooks and serving examples. Notebooks load the scripts they need
directly; CI and standalone apply scripts install them as a package. See
[`ci/README.md`](ci/README.md#pk_helpers) for contributor guidance.

Many serving examples include an `apply.py` (deploy + smoke-test) and a `cleanup.py`
(teardown of Kubernetes resources) alongside the notebook. These are used by the CI
orchestrator and can also be run manually.

## Note about storage
Storage on Kubernetes is a complex topic and a deep dive is outside the scope of this repository. There are two types
of storage you might encounter here — block and object storage.

### Block storage
The usual type of storage a Kubernetes pod might mount to persist data. An example in the context of this repo are
notebook volumes.

### Object storage
Object storage is any S3-like type of storage. Pipelines use object storage
extensively to store intermediate and final task/pipeline artifacts. Furthermore, KServe can be configured
to serve models directly from object storage.

prokube.ai comes pre-configured with integrated object storage. Alternatively, admins can configure pipelines
to use other instances of object storage (e.g. self-hosted S3-compatible storage, AWS S3, GCS, etc.).
Many S3 libraries use environment variables for their configuration — those are usually:
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `S3_ENDPOINT`. They are likely already
available in your environment. You can also ask your admin about them.

## Platform compatibility

Some examples require a minimum prokube platform version. If an example is not listed, no specific version requirement is known.

| Example | Min platform version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `serving/minimal-s3-model` | v1.7.0 | Requires s3creds secret with KServe support |

## CI

Examples are tested end-to-end by `ci/run_all.py`, which runs inside a Kubeflow
notebook pod. See [`ci/README.md`](ci/README.md) for how the orchestrator works and
how to add a new example to CI.

## Contributing
All code contributions should go via pull requests. Make sure your code is clearly documented and that it adheres
to established standards (e.g. PEP).

### Jupyter notebooks
Since this repo contains Jupyter notebooks we use [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) as
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook so all notebooks are stripped of cell outputs. Set it up locally for
yourself with:
```shell
pip install --upgrade nbstripout
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
This should enable the hooks.
Use `pre-commit run --all-files` to run the hooks.

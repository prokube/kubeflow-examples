# CI contributor guide

This guide explains how contributors and automation agents can run the example
suite and register new examples in `ci/run_all.py`.

---

## Running CI

Run the suite from a Kubeflow notebook pod with this repository checked out:

```bash
python ci/run_all.py
```

To preview the execution plan without running any examples:

```bash
python ci/run_all.py --dry-run
```

MLflow examples require the `mlflow-credentials` Kubernetes secret. Serving
examples that use external authentication require
`INFERENCE_SERVICE_API_KEY`. Examples with unavailable prerequisites are
reported as skipped. Run `python ci/run_all.py --help` for timeout and opt-in
options.

---

## Adding a new example

Register it in the `_EXAMPLES` list in `run_all.py`. Phase scheduling,
cleanup, dry-run output, credential checks, and environment-mutating ordering
are derived from this entry. Opt-in examples require the additional changes
described below.

```python
Example(
    name="serving/my-new-example",       # display name and result key
    steps=[
        Step("script", "serving/my-new-example/apply.py"),
        # or: Step("notebook", "serving/my-new-example/example.ipynb")
        # chain multiple steps if needed (executed sequentially)
    ],
    phase=1,                             # see Phase rules below
    cleanup="serving/my-new-example/cleanup.py",  # omit if no Kubernetes resources
    opt_in="include_foo",                # omit if always enabled
    mlflow_dependent=False,              # True = skip when MLflow creds absent
    api_key_dependent=False,             # True = skip when INFERENCE_SERVICE_API_KEY is unset
    env_mutating=False,                  # True = pip installs/upgrades packages;
                                          # runs before the rest of its phase (see below)
)
```

### env_mutating flag

Papermill executes each notebook in a separate `python3` kernel process, but
all kernels use the same Python environment and site-packages. CI does not
create an isolated environment for each notebook. If one notebook runs
`pip install --upgrade <pkg>` while another notebook is importing that
package, the concurrent reinstall can corrupt the import (e.g. `ModuleNotFoundError:
No module named 'pandas._libs.internals'` from a partially-replaced
compiled extension).

Set `env_mutating=True` when an example runs an active `pip install` or
`%pip install` command that installs or upgrades packages imported by other
examples in the same phase. Ignore commented-out installation examples.
`run_all.py` runs all `env_mutating` examples in a
phase to completion **before** starting the rest of that phase, instead of
placing everything in the same parallel batch. Prefer avoiding
`pip install --upgrade` in new examples entirely (pin/bake deps into the
notebook image); use `env_mutating=True` only when that is not
possible.

### Phase rules

| Phase | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Self-contained: does not depend on anything else in CI |
| 2 | Submits a KFP pipeline and returns fast; actual run is polled in Phase 4 |
| 3 | Requires a model already registered by the Phase 2 mlflow-mobile-price pipeline |

### Opt-in flag

Use opt-in when an example requires cluster add-ons (KEDA,
`postgres-operator`, GPU nodes) that may not be present. Add
`opt_in="include_foo"` to the `Example`, add an `include_foo` parameter to
`run_all()`, include it in the `opts` mapping, define the `--include-foo`
argument, and pass the parsed value to `run_all()`.

---

## apply.py and cleanup.py

### cleanup.py — always add when Kubernetes resources are created

Any example that creates Kubernetes resources (InferenceService, Deployment,
Service, CRD instance, …) must have a `cleanup.py` in its directory.
CI runs all cleanup scripts in parallel in a `finally` block so they execute
even on failure. This is best-effort: `_run_cleanup` gives each script a
120s budget and does not fail CI on a non-zero exit or timeout (only a
warning is logged) — cleanup failures are not treated as example failures.

A cleanup script must:
- Delete resources idempotently (`--ignore-not-found`)
- Never raise on failure (print a warning at most)
- Read the namespace from the pod filesystem:

```python
with open("/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace") as f:
    ns = f.read().strip()
```

**Do not** add a `cleanup.py` for examples that only create in-cluster
transient objects managed by KFP (pipeline runs, artifacts) — those are
cleaned up by KFP's own retention policy.

### apply.py — only for serving examples driven by a script

Add an `apply.py` only when the CI execution of a serving example is driven
by a Python script rather than a notebook.  This is the case when:

- The notebook's deploy/test section requires manual inputs that cannot be
  automated, so a separate script owns the full deploy-wait-smoketest cycle.
- The example has no notebook at all.

An `apply.py` must exit non-zero on failure (CI relies on the return code).
It must print a clean error message to stderr and suppress the full traceback:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        deploy()
    except Exception as exc:
        print(str(exc), file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
```

If you add an `apply.py`, always add the matching `cleanup.py` as well.

## pk_helpers

`pk_helpers` (source in `src/pk_helpers/`) contains prokube platform utilities
for notebooks and apply scripts. Notebooks load only the required script, so
users do not need to install the package:

```python
%run -n ~/examples/src/pk_helpers/mlflow_credentials.py
```

The `-n` option loads the functions without running the script's command-line
entry point. Interactive cells can then call the required function directly.

CI installs the package during preflight. Standalone `apply.py` scripts install
it automatically if it is not already available, so those scripts can use
normal package imports.

To install the package manually in an activated virtual environment, run:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

### setup_mlflow_credentials

Interactive. Stores MLflow credentials in the `mlflow-credentials` Kubernetes
Secret. First, create a Personal Access Token from `/mlflow/oidc/ui/auth` on
your prokube domain. Then run the setup cell; the script prompts for the MLflow
URI, email address, and token, and creates or updates the Secret:

```python
# Prompts for your MLflow URI, email, and PAT, then creates or updates the Secret.
setup_mlflow_credentials()
```

If the secret already exists, the script asks before replacing it and leaves
it unchanged by default. Tag this interactive cell with `ci-skip`. CI removes
the cell before execution, validates the preconfigured secret during
preflight, and skips MLflow-dependent examples if the secret is unavailable.

### load_mlflow_credentials

Call this from a notebook that communicates with MLflow directly rather than
through a KFP pipeline. It first uses `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`,
`MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME`, and `MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD` if all three are
set. Otherwise, it reads the `mlflow-credentials` Kubernetes secret. It adds
the resolved values and `MLFLOW_ENABLE_PROXY_MULTIPART_UPLOAD=true` to
`os.environ`, and raises a clear `RuntimeError` if no credentials are
available.

```python
%run -n ~/examples/src/pk_helpers/mlflow_credentials.py
load_mlflow_credentials()
```

### require_mlflow_secret

Call this before building or submitting a KFP pipeline whose tasks read MLflow
credentials via `use_secret_as_env(secret_name="mlflow-credentials", ...)`.
It checks that the secret exists before the pipeline is submitted, so a
missing secret produces a clear error in the notebook. Pipeline components
run in separate pods and must read credentials from the Kubernetes secret;
variables set only in the notebook are not available to them.

```python
%run -n ~/examples/src/pk_helpers/mlflow_credentials.py
require_mlflow_secret()
```

### get_or_create_api_key

Returns a model-serving API key: the `INFERENCE_SERVICE_API_KEY` env var if
an admin has injected one into the pod, otherwise an interactive prompt
(ask your cluster admin, or use pkui if available on your platform). Call it
from any notebook cell or script that needs an inference API key:

```python
%run -n ~/examples/src/pk_helpers/api_key.py
API_KEY = get_or_create_api_key()
```

CI runs headlessly and cannot answer the interactive prompt, so
`INFERENCE_SERVICE_API_KEY` **must** be exported before running
`ci/run_all.py`:

```bash
export INFERENCE_SERVICE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>   # ask your admin, or use pkui if available
```

CI validates this in the preflight check and skips `api_key_dependent`
examples if it is unset — mark any new example that calls
`get_or_create_api_key()` with `api_key_dependent=True`.

### internal_predict_url

Returns the correct **internal, in-cluster** predict URL for a KServe
InferenceService, compatible with both prokube generations:

- Currently released: hits the predictor Service directly —
  `http://<isvc-name>-predictor.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local/v1/models/<model-name>:predict`.
- Upcoming (agentgateway-based, not yet released): routes through the
  shared `agentgateway-proxy` Service instead —
  `http://agentgateway-proxy.agentgateway-system.svc.cluster.local/_platform/serving/<namespace>/<isvc-name>/v1/models/<model-name>:predict`.

It picks the URL via a plain DNS lookup for the `agentgateway-proxy` Service
(cached for the process) — no config flag needed, and no RBAC required
(unlike `kubectl get service`, which notebook pod service accounts
typically can't do cross-namespace; DNS resolution needs no permissions,
and a non-existent Service just fails to resolve). The request/response
payload format is unchanged either way (plain KServe V1 JSON, e.g.
`{"instances": [...]}`) — only the URL differs. Any example that predicts
against an InferenceService via its internal cluster URL (not the external
gateway URL) should use this instead of hardcoding the `<isvc>-predictor`
pattern:

```python
%run -n ~/examples/src/pk_helpers/kserve_url.py
url = internal_predict_url(isvc_name, namespace, model_name)
```

## ci-skip cell tag

Tag a notebook cell with `ci-skip` to have CI replace it with a no-op comment
before execution.  Use this **only** for cells that genuinely cannot run
headlessly:

- Cells that require manual input (hardcoded paths, paste-your-token
  placeholders, `input()` calls).
- Interactive widget cells (`ipywidgets`, `ipykernel` display-only code).

**Do not** use `ci-skip` to work around a fixable automation problem.  If a
cell fails because it needs credentials or a namespace, fix it to load those
automatically (see the MLflow credential pattern above).  `ci-skip` is a last
resort, not a convenience.

To tag a cell in JupyterLab: select the cell → Property Inspector (right
panel) → add `ci-skip` under Cell Tags.

In raw notebook JSON the tag appears as:

```json
"metadata": {
    "tags": ["ci-skip"]
}
```

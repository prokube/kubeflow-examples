## Adding a new example

Register it in the `_EXAMPLES` list in `run_all.py`.  Everything else —
phase scheduling, opt-in gating, cleanup, dry-run output, MLflow-credential
and API-key skipping, env-mutating ordering — is derived from that entry
automatically.

```python
Example(
    name="serving/my-new-example",       # display name and result key
    steps=[
        Step("script", "serving/my-new-example/apply.py"),
        # or: Step("notebook", "serving/my-new-example/example.ipynb")
        # chain multiple steps if needed (executed sequentially)
    ],
    phase=1,                             # see Phase rules below
    cleanup="serving/my-new-example/cleanup.py",  # omit if no K8s resources
    opt_in="include_foo",                # omit if always enabled
    mlflow_dependent=False,              # True = skip when MLflow creds absent
    api_key_dependent=False,             # True = skip when INFERENCE_SERVICE_API_KEY is unset
    env_mutating=False,                  # True = pip installs/upgrades packages;
                                          # runs before the rest of its phase (see below)
)
```

### env_mutating flag

Every notebook in a phase is executed via papermill against the **same**
`python3` kernel/site-packages — there is no per-notebook virtualenv.  If a
notebook runs `pip install --upgrade <pkg>` while another notebook in the
same phase is concurrently importing that package, the concurrent
reinstall can corrupt the import (e.g. `ModuleNotFoundError:
No module named 'pandas._libs.internals'` from a partially-replaced
compiled extension).

Set `env_mutating=True` on any example whose steps run `pip install` /
`%pip install` (uncommented, not `-q`-only-metadata, actually mutating
installed packages) against packages that other examples in the same
phase might import.  `run_all.py` runs all `env_mutating` examples in a
phase to completion **before** starting the rest of that phase, instead of
throwing everything into the same parallel batch.  Prefer avoiding
`pip install --upgrade` in new examples entirely (pin/bake deps into the
notebook image) — reach for `env_mutating=True` only when that isn't
possible.

### Phase rules

| Phase | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Self-contained: does not depend on anything else in CI |
| 2 | Submits a KFP pipeline and returns fast; actual run is polled in Phase 4 |
| 3 | Requires a model already registered by the Phase 2 mlflow-mobile-price pipeline |

### Opt-in flag

Add `opt_in="include_foo"` and a corresponding `--include-foo` argument in
the `__main__` block of `run_all.py`.  Use opt-in when the example requires
cluster add-ons (KEDA, postgres-operator, GPU nodes) that are not guaranteed
to be present.

---

## apply.py and cleanup.py

### cleanup.py — always add when K8s resources are created

Any example that creates Kubernetes resources (InferenceService, Deployment,
Service, CRD instance, …) must have a `cleanup.py` in its directory.
CI runs all cleanup scripts in parallel in a `finally` block so they execute
even on failure.

A cleanup script must:
- Delete resources idempotently (`--ignore-not-found`)
- Never raise on failure (print a warning at most)
- Read the namespace from the pod filesystem:

```python
with open("/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace") as f:
    ns = f.read().strip()
```

**Do not** add a `cleanup.py` for examples that only create in-cluster
transient objects managed by KFP (pipeline runs, artifacts) — those are
cleaned up by KFP's own retention policy.

### apply.py — only for serving examples driven by a script

Add an `apply.py` only when the CI execution of a serving example is driven
by a Python script rather than a notebook.  This is the case when:

- The notebook's deploy/test section requires manual inputs that cannot be
  automated, so a separate script owns the full deploy-wait-smoketest cycle.
- The example has no notebook at all.

An `apply.py` must exit non-zero on failure (CI relies on the return code).
It must print a clean error message to stderr and suppress the full traceback:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        deploy()
    except Exception as exc:
        print(str(exc), file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
```

If you add an `apply.py`, always add the matching `cleanup.py` as well.

## pk_helpers package

`pk_helpers` (source in `src/pk_helpers/`) bundles the prokube-platform
utilities importable from notebooks and apply scripts.  It is a regular,
installable Python package — install it once, editable, from the repo root:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

In notebooks, do this from a setup cell near the top:

```python
%pip install -q -e $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

Resolving the repo root via git (rather than a hardcoded `~/<dir-name>`
path) means this cell keeps working regardless of what directory the repo
is cloned into.

CI installs it automatically in the preflight step (`_ensure_pk_helpers`),
so `apply.py` scripts can `from pk_helpers import ...` without any path
wiring.  Every helper works identically whether called from a notebook cell
or from an `apply.py`.

### setup_mlflow_credentials

One-time, interactive.  Stores MLflow credentials in the
`mlflow-credentials` K8s secret.  **Requires human input** (the MLflow
Personal Access Token cannot be obtained programmatically).  Run it once from
a JupyterLab terminal via the installed console script:

```bash
pk-setup-mlflow-credentials
```

Do not call this from CI.  CI validates the secret exists in the preflight
check and skips MLflow-dependent examples if it does not.

### load_mlflow_credentials

Call from any notebook that talks to MLflow directly in its own process
(not via a KFP pipeline). Resolves credentials in order: (1)
`MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`/`_USERNAME`/`_PASSWORD` already set in the
environment — the escape hatch for notebooks run without the shared secret
— otherwise (2) the `mlflow-credentials` K8s secret. Sets the resolved
values (plus `MLFLOW_ENABLE_PROXY_MULTIPART_UPLOAD=true`) on `os.environ`
and raises `RuntimeError` with actionable guidance if neither is
available.

```python
from pk_helpers import load_mlflow_credentials

load_mlflow_credentials()
```

### require_mlflow_secret

Call before building/submitting a KFP pipeline whose tasks read MLflow
credentials via `use_secret_as_env(secret_name="mlflow-credentials", ...)`.
Fails fast with a clear error if the secret is missing, instead of letting
the pipeline fail later inside a task pod. Unlike `load_mlflow_credentials`,
there's no env-var fallback — task pods can only read the K8s secret.

```python
from pk_helpers import require_mlflow_secret

require_mlflow_secret()
```

### get_or_create_api_key

Returns a model-serving API key: the `INFERENCE_SERVICE_API_KEY` env var if
an admin has injected one into the pod, otherwise an interactive prompt
(ask your cluster admin, or use pkui if available on your platform). Call it
from any notebook cell or script that needs an inference API key:

```python
from pk_helpers import get_or_create_api_key

API_KEY = get_or_create_api_key()
```

CI runs headlessly and cannot answer the interactive prompt, so
`INFERENCE_SERVICE_API_KEY` **must** be exported before running
`ci/run_all.py`:

```bash
export INFERENCE_SERVICE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>   # ask your admin, or use pkui if available
```

CI validates this in the preflight check and skips `api_key_dependent`
examples if it is unset — mark any new example that calls
`get_or_create_api_key()` with `api_key_dependent=True`.

### internal_predict_url

Returns the correct **internal, in-cluster** predict URL for a KServe
InferenceService, compatible with both prokube generations:

- Currently released: hits the predictor Service directly —
  `http://<isvc-name>-predictor.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local/v1/models/<model-name>:predict`.
- Upcoming (agentgateway-based, not yet released): routes through the
  shared `agentgateway-proxy` Service instead —
  `http://agentgateway-proxy.agentgateway-system.svc.cluster.local/_platform/serving/<namespace>/<isvc-name>/v2/models/<model-name>/infer`.

It picks the URL via a plain DNS lookup for the `agentgateway-proxy` Service
(cached for the process) — no config flag needed, and no RBAC required
(unlike `kubectl get service`, which notebook pod service accounts
typically can't do cross-namespace; DNS resolution needs no permissions,
and a non-existent Service just fails to resolve). The request/response
payload format is unchanged either way (plain KServe V1 JSON, e.g.
`{"instances": [...]}`) — only the URL differs. Any example that predicts
against an InferenceService via its internal cluster URL (not the external
gateway URL) should use this instead of hardcoding the `<isvc>-predictor`
pattern:

```python
from pk_helpers import internal_predict_url

url = internal_predict_url(isvc_name, namespace, model_name)
```

## ci-skip cell tag

Tag a notebook cell with `ci-skip` to have CI replace it with a no-op comment
before execution.  Use this **only** for cells that genuinely cannot run
headlessly:

- Cells that require manual input (hardcoded paths, paste-your-token
  placeholders, `input()` calls).
- Interactive widget cells (`ipywidgets`, `ipykernel` display-only code).

**Do not** use `ci-skip` to work around a fixable automation problem.  If a
cell fails because it needs credentials or a namespace, fix it to load those
automatically (see the MLflow credential pattern above).  `ci-skip` is a last
resort, not a convenience.

To tag a cell in JupyterLab: select the cell → Property Inspector (right
panel) → add `ci-skip` under Cell Tags.

In raw notebook JSON the tag appears as:

```json
"metadata": {
    "tags": ["ci-skip"]
}
```

# Minimal MLflow Model Inference

This directory shows how to deploy an MLflow-tracked model as a KServe
InferenceService using the v2 inference protocol. It uses the built-in
`mlflow` model format in KServe, so no custom container image is required.

## Prerequisites

- A model trained and registered in MLflow. See the
  [mobile price classification MLflow example](../../mlflow/mobile-price-classification/)
  for how to train and register the SVM model used here.
- `kubectl` access to your prokube namespace (`kubectl` is preinstalled in
  prokube notebooks).
- Python with the `requests` package (`requests` is preinstalled in prokube
  notebooks).
- An `mlflow-credentials` Kubernetes secret in your namespace.

## Why a dedicated ServiceAccount is required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> MLflow ISVCs **must** use the dedicated `mlflow-isvc-sa` ServiceAccount
> defined in `ServiceAccount.yaml`. Do not use the namespace `default` SA.

### Root cause: KServe S3 credential injection conflict

KServe v0.18.0 automatically injects S3 credentials into the
`storage-initializer` init container for every ISVC whose ServiceAccount
references a secret annotated as an S3 credential source (e.g. the
`s3creds` secret present in every prokube namespace).

The injection produces two kinds of env entries for the same variable names
(`S3_ENDPOINT`, `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`, `S3_USE_HTTPS`, etc.):

| Source | Env form |
|---|---|
| Secret annotations (`serving.kserve.io/s3-endpoint`, `s3-usehttps`, …) | `value: <literal>` |
| Secret keys (mounted via `valueFrom.secretKeyRef`) | `valueFrom: {secretKeyRef: …}` |

Kubernetes rejects a container spec that sets **both** `value` and
`valueFrom` on the same env var. The admission webhook blocks the pod, the
storage-initializer never runs, and the ISVC times out with
`timed out waiting for condition`.

This only affects `mlflow://` ISVCs: S3-backed ISVCs (`s3://`) rely on
exactly that injection and work correctly with the `default` SA.

### The fix

`ServiceAccount.yaml` defines `mlflow-isvc-sa`, a dedicated SA that:

- Holds the `regcred-prokube` and `regcred-dev` imagePullSecrets so that
  the private prokube storage-initializer image can be pulled.
- Does **not** reference `s3creds`, so KServe skips S3 credential injection
  entirely for any ISVC that uses it.

Both `InferenceService.yaml` and `apply.py` already reference this SA.

## Deploy the InferenceService

1. Apply the ServiceAccount (once per namespace):

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f ServiceAccount.yaml -n <your-namespace>
   ```

2. Open `InferenceService.yaml` and replace the placeholder values:

   | Placeholder | Description |
   |---|---|
   | `<inference-name>` | A name for your InferenceService (e.g. `mobile-price-svm`) |
   | `<workspace-name>` | Your Kubeflow namespace / workspace |
   | `<your-user>` | Your username, matching the model name registered in MLflow |

   You can also adjust the model version number at the end of the `storageUri`
   (e.g. `/2` refers to version 2 of the registered model).

   The `storageUri` uses the `mlflow://` scheme, which tells KServe to fetch
   the model artifact directly from the MLflow model registry.

   > [!WARNING]
   > Using the `mlflow://` scheme requires an MLflow
   > `ClusterStorageContainer` and prokube platform version 1.7.0 or later.

3. Apply the manifest:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f InferenceService.yaml -n <your-namespace>
   ```

4. Wait for the InferenceService to become ready. You can check the status in
   the Kubeflow Endpoints UI or via:
   ```sh
   kubectl get inferenceservice -n <your-namespace>
   ```

Alternatively, deploy and test the service automatically:

```sh
export INFERENCE_SERVICE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
python apply.py
```

If `INFERENCE_SERVICE_API_KEY` is not set, `apply.py` prompts for it.

## Test the Deployment

A test script and sample request body are provided to verify the deployment.

> [!TIP]
> The test script needs a model-serving API key. Ask your cluster administrator
> for one, or use pkui if it is available on your platform.

1. Set the required environment variables (optional):
   ```sh
   export API_KEY=<your-api-key>          # ask your admin, or use pkui if available
   export INFERENCE_SERVICE_URI=<your-inference-service-url>
   export PROTOCOL_VERSION=v2
   ```
   You can find the inference service URL in the Kubeflow Endpoints UI.

2. Run the test script:
   ```sh
   python test_inference_service.py \
     --model <inference-name> \
     --json v2-mlflow-inference-body.json
   ```

   The script sends the sample request to the deployed model and prints the
   response.

   If `API_KEY` or `INFERENCE_SERVICE_URI` are not set as environment
   variables, the script will prompt you for them interactively.

## Request Body Format

The provided `v2-mlflow-inference-body.json` follows the
[v2 inference protocol](https://kserve.github.io/website/latest/modelserving/data_plane/v2_protocol/).
Each feature is specified as a separate input with a name, shape, datatype, and
data array. The sample contains 5 data points across 20 features from the
mobile price classification dataset.

The test script also supports the v1 protocol. To use it, set
`PROTOCOL_VERSION=v1` and provide a v1-formatted request body.
